The original ScanTool would not run on EEE-PC's native resolution of 800x480 because it is hardcoded to run at 640x480.

The old fonts for sensor outputs are too small. By enlarging the fonts, it creates another problem because the strings would be too wide.

The new layout: Less sensors per page, bigger fonts.
