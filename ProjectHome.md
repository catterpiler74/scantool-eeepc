## ScanTool For Netbooks ##

This is a modified version of ScanTool.net OBD-II Software. It is modified so that it would work on netbooks with smaller native resolutions. Some controls are re-scaled to fit the small screens better. Sensor outputs are also enlarged to increase readability inside of vehicles while driving.

You need a compatible OBD-II interface first before you can use this software. I tested this with my ELM327 chip via Bluetooth.
