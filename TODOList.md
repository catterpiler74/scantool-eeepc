1. Hardcode it to start in windowed mode to save time.
Would it run on non-native resolution?

2. Refresh all sensors instead of ones in the page.
Would bluetooth keep up with the refresh rate?

3. Fuel economy
Need to refresh MAF sensor & VSS sensor to calculate fuel efficiency.
Correct it with O2 sensor if possible.

4. Hide the console window

5. Disable all sensors that are not supported so that ECU doesn't timeout (hopefully)
